### What is BrewClub?

BrewClub is aimed at grabbing beer-nerds and enthusiasts and introducing them to homebrewing. I strongly feel that my understanding the brewing process, and making your own beer you have a much better understanding of beer in general; styles, flavours, impact of ingredients, process and equipment... and even flaws. Like any activity - sport, music etc - participating rather than spectating gives you a better appreciation for how or why something is the way it is, or just the skill that went into making it.

BrewClub is primarily aimed at people who are interested and curious about brewing, but have never tried. Maybe that's because they don't know where or how to start or concerns about time, cost, space, startup costs or any other reasons. It's designed to be done as a group with friends as a shared experience. Having said that though there is no reason if you are an experienced brewer that you can't join - the more experienced brewers who help others start and learn, the better! And if you haven't got a group, it's still possible to join in.

BrewClub should be
- simple and easy to participate in, no matter your circumstances
- minimal time and effort
- low initial cost outlay (and loss if you should stop)
- minimal space or other special requirements

BrewClub should be seen as a journey that you can start from nothing with, will help you get going and gain experience and you can take as far as you like. If you get what you want from the early stages, that's great! At the same time though, by progressing at each stage, you will build more skills, and gain experience that will help you go as far as you wish to go until you are able to stand on your own, and brew what you want. But just remember, this is a choose your own adventure, *you* get to decide how far you want to go and how much *you* want to invest!

### How?!

Ok... that sounds like a pink fluffy unicorn... how do we achive this?!

- BrewClub is split into a series of brews that start at the very simple and gradually become more complex. This means that the process is not overwhelming, and gradually builds skills and experience. It also allows for the greatest chance of success!
- Each brew, by default, will make around 4 liters of finished beer (or cider). For most, this is a manageble brew
    - it does not require a huge amount of space to ferment, or store
    - it is a quantity that doesn't require weeks (or months) to consume (drinking the *same* thing) - allowing you to have variety, rather than quantity as well as being able to enjoy it at it's best!
    - when graudating to the more advanced brews, smaller batch sizes make cleaning easier (hopefully!)
    - smaller batch sizes keeps equipment costs lower and manageble

*If you do wish to brew more, that is possible. Generally speaking this will be in multiples of the base batch size, though in each brew there will be details on how to do bigger batches as there are potential gotchas in the brewing, fermenting and bottling/kegging.*

- Brewing equipment and supplies have come a long way in the last 5, 10, 20 (and even longer) - costs have dropped, and options increased. BrewClub would probably not have been possible as it is here even 2 years ago! This allows us to use cheap, simple equipment that, if even if you stop you can reuse, sell, or even throw away and not lose a lot of money. In each Brew we will give you the cheapest, simplest solution, but explain how you can spend a little extra to gain something - maybe that's a simpler process, or better product. The aim is also at each step to build on what you already have - that what you own should be reused without needing to buy anything more. Only after you commit to the hobby and you *want* to spend more should you need to. For example:
    - Fermentation: this will be a 5 Liter plastic bucket and compact air lock. It is small, cheap, easily obtained and robust enough. If you stop brewing, you can repurpose it for any general bucket needs, give it to another brewer or throwing it away won't break the bank. 
    - Bottling: Rather than bottles, BrewClub will use the relative new Oxebar 4 Liter PET Kegs. As far as kegs go, they are cheap and almost disposable (but absolutely reusable!) Any homebrewer will tell you how painful bottling can be, so for BrewClub we will skip it entirely! The Oxebars cost around the same as bottles and mean a much faster, simpler bottling day! The keg can be easily repurposed for water storage (camping for example) or even used to make large SodaStream at home. For the low cost option, the beer/cider will be carbonated *naturally* (with sugar and secondary fermentation, meaning no CO2 bottle or regulator required). Serving will be via a cheap Picnic tap - the entire Keg Setup is less than 300 SEK. There is ample room for improvement in this regard, steel kegs, CO2 bottles and regulators and pub-style taps. You can start small, and upgrade as you need! The Oxebar Keg and Picnic tap is great for parties, picnics - imagine a Keg of Julmust for the kids at Christmas! or your own Homebrew at a BBQ!

... that's all you need to get started! cheap and simple right? If you have brewed before, you might notice I skipped over a lot of the details... that's because this is just an introduction. The aim of BrewClub is to *exlain* all the options available; the pro's and con's and let you make a decision for what suits *you* best. Your situation is different to mine, your goals are different, so what works for me, might not work for you. As I explained in the main [introduction](/docs/intro.md) I get very frustrated by a *"you should do this, because it's what I do"* attitude that I find in a lot of home brew forums. I'd rather explain why we do things, so you understand and can tailor things to your needs. There is no one way, but there are also some preferred ways!

So what will you brew in BrewClub?


1. **BrewClub #1**: This is the ground floor for everyone where you collect your equipment and make your first brew. We will take an off-the-shelf fresh wort kit (which is just unfermented beer). Fresh Wort Kits come as a Bag-in-Box and can be anywhere from 15 Liters to 20 Liters. That is one FWK will be split across 4-5 people. Each brewer will choose their yeast and dry-hop to be added during fermentation. Upon completion then, *everyone* should have their own, unique beer - although the base was the same, everyone will have something slightly different. This is where community comes into play! At the end of the brew, we will get togther to taste each others brew! 

As you can see BrewClub #1 will give you a low cost, low effort way to dip a toe in homebrewing, that you can share with friends. If you can store a 5 liter bucket somewhere between 20°C and 25°C for a few weeks, and drop some hops/yeast in the bucket... then this should be easy!

Fresh Wort Kits come in a variety of styles, so together we will decide what to brew, and we can repeat as many times as we like for as many styles as we like before moving on. With each brew things like cleaning, sanitation, fermenting, bottling and conditioning will become second nature and you will develop a process that works for you.

2. **BrewClub #2** is only a simple step forward - this time we're making cider. In some ways it's as easy (if not easier) than #1; The reason it's the second brew is to introduce the concept of Yeast Nutrient which is required for Cider. There is also the ability to learn about tinctures and adjuncts (in addition to dry hopping from #1). For example, rather than a straight cider you might like to make an Apple Pie cider with Vanilla and Cinnamon, or a Dry Hopped cider... what about an Oaked cider?!

Given how simple they are, BrewClub #1 and BrewClub #2 are interchangeable and repeatable. If you stopped here, you would still have the ability and equipment to make some great beers and ciders, just the way you like them. 

3. **BrewClub #3** is where we make a giant leap forward! We're now going to do a "mini mash" or "partial mash" using Dry Malt Extract. Instead of buying a ready made wort kit, this will be the first chance to make your own. We will take some Dry Malt Extract, some specialty grains and hops. We will do a partial mash, a boil with hop additions and wort cooling. In this you will learn a lot of the foundations of brewing, whilst still taking small steps in complexity! But don't worry, many an award winning beer has been brewed this way. In fact James from Verdant who are world renowned for their hazy New England style beers started with this is exact method. Extract and Partial Mash brews give you a lot more flexibility and ability to fine tune the process, but in terms of complexity is no harder than making a cup of tea. In this brew you will need a few new pieces of equipment, like a pot, sieve etc - but you likely own these already. If you only have a small pot, you don't need to buy a new one, instead you will learn how to do partial boils instead! 

4. **BrewClub #4** is the final step (for now!) where we go the whole way and do an all-grain brew! no short cuts, no pre-prepared wort, nothing! Everything will be done by your own hands, and if you have come this far, this will be a walk in the park, but the results will blow your mind! And guess what? no extra equiment required again! You have made it this far, with all the brews you made, with just a bucket, airlock, keg and picnic tap!

Above I say *for now*, the beauty is that you now have the basic skills to make many, many beers - where you go next is up to you and what you want to learn!
- do you like big stouts? well, High ABV brewing is an art in itself. If you want to make Omnipollo style Pastry Stouts be prepared for some hard work! (or grab an imperial stout FWK and make one as per BrewClub #1!)
- do you like Czech style lagers? then maybe decoction mashes are what you want? or learning about lagering and conditioning... noble hops
- Big Juicy, Hazy New Englad style IPA's? Then oxidation and closed transfers are in your fututure (a process by the way which is absolutely achievable with some small additions to the brew equipment you already have!)
- Turbid mashes and cool-ships for wild fermented lambics?

As you can see, once you get through Brews 1-4 (in your own time!) you have the skills and the brewing world opens up. In these pages you will find references and starting points for your journey.

If you are fortunate enough to have some experienced brewers in your BrewClub, ask them for help and advice. Ask your local brew shops who are more than willing to help. EVERYTHIN I have written here, I have learned from asking some amazing people who have been generous with their time and knowledge, reading some excellent books that you will find in the reference section and asking lots of questions in many forums. Don't be afraid to ask!

If you have an idea for a brew you would like to do, you can always ask and maybe we can write it up here!

One last word on equipment, you can scale

### Open Source?


<u>::: Open Questions:::</u>
- Commercial Kits often produce between 19L and 25L - why? 
    - is it the right balance of batch size (output) vs overhead of mashing/boiling/cleaning
    - is it that for home systems, 20L is the right size for efficiency of mashing?
    - is it that 20L is about what people can consume in a reaosnable time
    - is it that 20L is a good size for home equipment? cost, size, etc?
    - mix of all the above?

Other Options considered
- pinter.. unitank

Equipment → buy more kegs to keep the fermenter going ; cheap scaling 
- Cleaning → dishwasher 
- More detailed information on breakout pages → sanitation 
- Make reference page → staging
- Glossary and tool tips?
- Open questions
	- Transport fermenter of wort 
	- Sanitizing without buying a load of sanitizer


Split this page out to multiple; it's far too long
read and re-word; far too much repetition
look into the flow of information - is all this needed now? is it better to introduce information little-by-little?
